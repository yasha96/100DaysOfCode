Problem: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. An increasing subsequence is a sequence of numbers in the array that can be obtained by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```
For example:
Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], which has a length of 4.
```
