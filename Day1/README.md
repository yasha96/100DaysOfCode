Problem: Knight's Tour

Given a chessboard of size N x N, the Knight's Tour problem asks for a sequence of moves by a knight on the chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

Implementing the solution using depth-first search (DFS) - this includes exploring all possible moves from each square until a valid tour is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.
