Problem: Knight's Tour

Given a chessboard of size N x N, the Knight's Tour problem asks for a sequence of moves by a knight on the chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

Implementing the solution using depth-first search (DFS) - this includes exploring all possible moves from each square until a valid tour is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.


Sample output:

Enter the value of N, i.e the chess square size: 8
[0, 59, 38, 33, 30, 17, 8, 63]
[37, 34, 31, 60, 9, 62, 29, 16]
[58, 1, 36, 39, 32, 27, 18, 7]
[35, 48, 41, 26, 61, 10, 15, 28]
[42, 57, 2, 49, 40, 23, 6, 19]
[47, 50, 45, 54, 25, 20, 11, 14]
[56, 43, 52, 3, 22, 13, 24, 5]
[51, 46, 55, 44, 53, 4, 21, 12]
